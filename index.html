  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.

    <h1>Don't be Afraid to Ask for Help</h1>
    <p>One of the reasons why people give up early when learning programming is because they encounter some sort of bug
      in their program that seems difficult to solve.</p>

    <p>But you should know that no one knows it all when it comes to programming. Even software developers with decades
      of experience still encounter bugs they find very hard to solve on their own.</p>

    <p>This is a major reason why collaboration is so important â€“ even more so than developing your personal skills.</p>

    <p>Whenever you find yourself in this situation, do not linger on the problem for too long. Use the internet to your
      advantage when searching for answers. In this regard, your best friend is Google. You can get the answer to almost
      everything related to programming on Google if you take your time and search deeply.</p>

    <p>If you are unable to get the answer you need from searching on Google, then the next step to take is to go to the
      study community you belong to get help from others. They will typically be more than willing to help you, whatever
      the problem may be.</p>
